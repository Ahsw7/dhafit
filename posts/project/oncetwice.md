In this project, I created a unofficial TWICE website that provides info about TWICE.

I combined two websites from the official Japanese and Korean websites, so fans no longer have to struggle to find info from the two websites.

This project is a open source. So you can see the source code on [this repository](https://github.com/dhafitf/twice).
